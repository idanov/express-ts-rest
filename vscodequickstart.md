# Getting Started with Node, Express and Visual Studio Code
This is a sample customized for development using [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com) and [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).  

Instructions to install the latest Node.js binaries can be found [here](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions).

This sample illustrates:
- **Great IntelliSense**: [TypeScript definition files](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped) provide IntelliSense for Node, Express, Mocha, and Gulp. Use [tsd](http://definitelytyped.org/tsd/) to install additional typings.

- **Build**: Compile your [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/) files to JavaScript by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+B` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+B` (OS X). You can also let gulp watch for file changes and automatically build by running `gulp watch` from the terminal.

- **Test**: [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) is a popular test framework for Node applications. Press `Ctrl+Shift+T` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+T` (OS X) to run the tests.

- **Debugging**: [Launch Configurations](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/debugging) are used for running your application under the debugger as well as launching the Mocha tests under the debugger. Open the Debug viewlet, select `Launch ./src/www` and press `F5` to run the application.

- **Integration with existing tools**: [Task Configurations](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/tasks) allow for control over how individual [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) tasks are launched. Run individual tasks from the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+P` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+P` (OS X), type in `task` and then press `space` to see all of the tasks in the provided `gulpfile.js`.
